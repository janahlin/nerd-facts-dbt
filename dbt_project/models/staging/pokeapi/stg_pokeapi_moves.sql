/*
  Model: stg_pokeapi_moves
  Description: Standardizes PokÃ©mon move data from the PokeAPI
  Source: raw.pokeapi_moves
  
  Notes:
  - Effect entries are extracted with language preference for English entries
  - Move classifications are derived from damage class, type and effect text
  - NULL handling is added for all numeric fields and JSON extraction
  - Additional move statistics calculated for battle analysis
